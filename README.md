# Restart Marketplace
This was our final project in Restart Network. We worked together with @talar90 and @adrianabelei on this project. Restart Network asked us to create their own online marketplace for students. <br> The main feature is voice recognition, so admins can work with voice commands to take or add money. There are different kind of features. We worked as
a team and used SCRUM.

# Technologies:
 Node.js, React.js, Express, Web Speech API, MongoDB, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
